================

Control Cisco devices from its CLI via ssh/telnet. This class requires the Expect perl module.

**Note: This is an old perl library that I do not use any more and have not maintained in a very long time. It's simply here for posterity.**

For a newer PHP solution please see my [lifo101/remote-control](https://github.com/lifo101/remote-control) repository.
